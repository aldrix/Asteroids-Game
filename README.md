# Asteroids
Help **Astro** move around the asteroids belt and collect *Khalum*, a strange mineral found only in asteroids.
Khalum is used for many things, but most importantly, its components are the main source to create nutritional suplements

Astro, **Eddie** (the ship's IA) and you will have to face the deep space problems and, of course, complete your missions.
Are you ready?
